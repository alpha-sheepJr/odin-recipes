    <p>Orange Tofu is a vegetarian take on the chinese-style Orange Chicken recipe. Sweet and tangy, this dish pairs well with basamati rice and broccoli.</p>
    <h2>Ingredents:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tofu:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 14 ounce block extra firm tofu, pressed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon low sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (29 g) cornstarch</li>
      </ul>     
      <br />
      <li>Orange Sauce:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2" knob of ginger, finely minced or grated</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes (<em>optional</em>)</li>
        <li>1 cup (236 ml) freshly squeezed orange juice, strained</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (55 g) loosely packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) reduced-sodium tamari</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon orange zest (about 1 small orange)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Preheat the oven to 425F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Tear the tofu into bite-sized chunks for a more chicken-like texture, or cut into small cubes.</li>
      <li><strong>Tofu:</strong> Add the tofu into a medium bowl and add in the oil and tamari. Toss with a spatula until evenly coated, then sprinkle the cornstarch on top and toss again. Transfer to a baking sheet and spread out the tofu pieces so they arent touching. Bake on the top rack of the oven for 30 minutes, flipping the tofu halfway through.</li>
      <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> Once the tofu has gone into the oven, begin preppiing the sauce. Wawrm the sesame oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Once warm, add the garlic, ginger, and optional red chili flakes. Saute for 60 seconds, then add in the orange juice, brown sugar, tamari, vinegar, and orange zest. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Mix the cornstarch with water until dissolved, then add the slurry to the sauce and simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and can coat the back of a spoon.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the tofu from the oven and add it to the pan, coating all sides of the tofu in the glossy orange sauce. Serve warm, over rice or as desired. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
