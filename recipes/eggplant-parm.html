    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious, cheesy classic that hits home. Often paired with pasta, it is an excellent main course that is relatively cheap and filling. One of my favorites!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Eggplant</li>
      <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Parmigianno Reggiano</li>
      <li>Marinara</li>
      <li>Mozzarella</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Italian herbs</li>
      <li>Fresh basil & oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Salt the eggplant.</strong> After slicing the eggplant into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick cuts, sprinkle with coarse salt and let hte salt sit for 10 minutes. This helps release excess moisture from the eggplant.</li>
      <li><strong>Pat the eggplant dry.</strong> Then use paper towels to pat the eggplant dry, wiping off the additional salt as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Dip in flour.</strong> First, coat the eggplant with flour on both sides and along the skin-side.</li>
      <li><strong>Dip in egg-mixture.</strong> Then transfer to the whisked eggs, and coat on both sides.</li>
      <li><strong>Coat in breadcrumbs.</strong> Transfer to the breadcrumb bowl and lightly pack the breadcrumbs using your hands. Shake off excess crumbs and arrange on a sheet pan. (If you are baking the eggplant and not frying it, make sure the sheet pan is brushed with oil ahead of time).</li>
      <li><strong>Baking method:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350F, and arrange the breaded eggplant slices on a sheet pan brushed with olive oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li><strong>Pan fry method:</strong> In a skillet with 1-2 Tablespoons of oil at a time, brown breaded eggplant for 2-3 minutes on each side. Repeat until all of the eggplant is finished. Place on paper towels after browning to absorb the extra oils.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer a baking dish with sauce.</strong> In a large baking dish, spread a layer of marinara on the bottom.</li>
      <li><strong>Add browned eggplant slices.</strong> Then on top of the sauce, add a layer of breaded and browned eggplant slices that were either baked or fried. </li>
      <li><strong>Layer with mozzarella.</strong> Top each of the browned eggplant slices with mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer with sauce.</strong> Top with a spoonful of marinara sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Top with parmesan, then bake.</strong> Then sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers: eggplant, mozzarella, sauce, then parmesan. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 400F. Top with fresh basil and oregano before serving.</li>
